More 4 Snow, an AGOT submod (CKII)
  by Seanr707

[SPOILERS AFFC!]

This is just a small submod that adds a little bit to playing as Jon Snow in the AFFC bookmark. I have never released a mod or submod before, so if any vets notice anything, please send me a message and I will fix it!

What this mod adds:

* Jon receives troops for each Lord that supports him. This is done to allow the player more control over the victory. For RP purposes, just imagine that each Lord is sending Jon a small garrison to help him out.
* When Stannis offers a marriage with Val, Jon will now also have the option to marry his other prisoner, Asha Greyjoy. This would benefit both Asha and Jon in the long run, and her personality would interact interestingly with Jon's.

Possible conflicts:

* Any mod that alters the AFFC event files. This mod replaces that file, so if you wish to use another mod that edits it, you will need to merge the files.
