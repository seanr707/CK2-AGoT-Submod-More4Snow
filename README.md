More 4 Snow, an AGOT submod (CKII)
  by Seanr707

[SPOILERS AFFC!]

This is just a small submod that adds a little bit to playing as Jon Snow in the AFFC bookmark *if you choose to be legitimised*. I have never released a mod or submod before, so if any vets notice anything, please send me a message and I will fix it!

Changelog:

v0.2 [2015/11/28]
* Fixed doomstack that was spawning
* Added possible events from Littlefinger
* Fixed Asha's (in)fertility

What this mod adds:

* Jon receives troops for each Lord that supports him. This is done to allow the player more control over the victory. For RP purposes, just imagine that each Lord is sending Jon a small garrison to help him out.
* When Stannis offers a marriage with Val, Jon will now also have the option to marry his other prisoner, Asha Greyjoy. This would benefit both Asha and Jon in the long run, and her personality would interact interestingly with Jon's.
* Littlefinger may offer you a deal

Author's Notes About Role Play and the Mod:

  I understand my additions may not fit with some character's motives, ambitions, or personalities. If that is what you want then I advise not using this mod. While this mod does not add anything too unreal (i.e. Goblins emerging from the ground and dancing to dubstep), it does add possibilites that would likely have never happened in the books/show. My current direction with the mod is **a)** learning more about CK2 modding, and **b)** adding fun events to Jon ~Snow~ Stark, and breathing new life into a playthrough that many people have likely played many times already.

Possible conflicts:

* Any mod that alters the AFFC event files. This mod replaces that file, so if you wish to use another mod that edits it, you will need to merge the files.
